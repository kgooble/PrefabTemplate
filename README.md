Hello there! This is the PrefabTemplate project.

## Purpose
To allow automated creation of prefabs that follow a specific template.

Given a set of prefabs that have PrefabTemplate components on them, and a
directory of images to use, auto-generate real prefabs by swapping out images
(and other properties). Manual selection of values is enabled via an editor
window.
